For a while I have been looking for a way to thoroughly document and present my experiences with various tools and frameworks. After introducing the techradar concept at work I set out to build my own techradar with **VueJS** and **Google Firebase**. I run one techradar instance as part of my online CV that details my experience with various tools. The code itself is open for everyone to use on GitHub.
