\begin{entrylist}
\entry
{2016--2019}
{Solution Architect}
{Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart DE}
{Responsible for backend architecture of connected vehicle services. This included designing cloud solutions according to domain driven principles as well as implementing features in our SCRUM team. Investing heavily into automation with Terraform my daily job was somewhere between solution architect and software engineer.

\end{entrylist}
\begin{entrylist}
\entry
{2010--2012}
{Test manager for driver monitoring software}
{Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart DE}
{Responsible for planning automotive software tests from unit to system level. On system level I was also responsible for designing and implementing the test environment for hardware in the loop simulation of a automotive ECU. This had to be integrated into existing quality frameworks and comply with functional safety according to ISO26262.

\skills{aquired skills}{systems engineering, project management, vehicle communication (CAN/FlexRay), test methodology, CANoe, VBA}

\section{\color{blue}education}

\begin{entrylist}

\entry
{2017--2018}
{Artificial Intelligence {\normalfont Nanodegree}}
{Udacity}
{Pursuing a deeper understanding of AI fundamentals I chose to join the nanodegree program and improve my knowledge in game agents, probabilistics and other AI methods. In my third term I specialized in computer vision methods.}

\entry
{2017}
{Deep Learning {\normalfont Foundation Nanodegree}}
{Udacity}
{Intrigued and fascinated by the advances of artificial intelligence I wanted to get a deeper understanding of the topic and joined the class of Udacitys newly introduced Deep Learning program. Within the course I worked on several projects ranging from image recognition to generative networks.}

\entry
{2007--2010}
{Bachelor {\normalfont of Engineering,} 1.3}
{Hochschule Heilbronn, DE}
{With a grant from Bosch I studied different fields of mechatronics and microsystems engineering. For my thesis I analyzed the influence of advanced driver assistance systems on steering based driver monitoring systems. The main focus was on data analytics and combined Matlab with scientific knowledge.
}

\entry
{2005--2007}
{Vocational training}
{Robert Bosch GmbH, DE}
{During my vocational training I learned the basics of engineering and how they relate to the physical world. The broad scope of topics covered in mechatronics also quickly made me realize my love for programming over the other possible fields in engineering.
