  headline: nodeMCU based moisture monitoring for plants 🌱 with a serverless backend
  description: Wanting to develop a small IoT solution I built plantbuddy as a standalone solution with device code written in C for **ESP8266** microcontrollers, using **Googles Firebase** infrastructure as a database and **VueJS** as a frontend. See repository for details on the system design.

  description: Long term project trying to bring **Node.js** on **robots** to a higher level and integrate it with [ROS](http://www.ros.org/). Trying out different cheap hardware components, bringing together resources in one repository needed to create a robot fullstack from hardware to control logic. This is more of a collaboration project than a single working solution. Check out the repository to see the different robot systems I implemented in there.

  description: Automatically sync sourcecode from one computer to another and execute the code remotely. This is a CLI I built to be able to develop **Node.js** programs on my develop machine and execute them on a raspberry pi without having to set up rsync and autoreload manually all the time.

  description: During a 24h hackathon two of us built this **distributed web app** with **augmented reality** features. The solution should enable teachers to get feedback anonymously from everyone in the class without the need for additional expensive equipment. To participate you need a phone with a browser capable of WebRTC (currently not supported by Safari 2017-05). Check out the demo and the explanation on the github repo.

  headline: my (first) attempt at writing a C++ based graphics demo 🌏💥
  description: Spending a weekend at the world's largest demo party ([revision 2018](https://2018.revision-party.net/)) I learned the basics of drawing on a 2D canvas with C++ and how to build basic 3D raytracing and texture mapping on spheres. No graphic libraries - just code.
